# Summary 
Project to practice Test Driven Development drawing on the tutorial here: https://dev.to/maxhumber/how-to-send-and-schedule-emails-with-python-dnb


# 5/17/22
Opted for a simpler file structure (aka not making send email a full package) so I could focus on the important part of this project, the TDD part. I may go back to it. 
# 5/18/22
Got the project to the point where it sends emails! I also found out that gmail won't allow smtp access via less secure apps after May 30th so I got a bit demoralized. I have three more features that I want to implement (load emails from csv, load body by class name, batch emails) which I'll finish tomorrow and then stop

# 5/19/22 
Didn't have a ton of time today, got the load emails part tested/implemented. I'm appreciating that tests don't need to be particularly clever, they should just test what is needed.
